    written and write an async routine called wait_n that takes
    in 2 int arguments (in this order): n and max_delay. You will
    spawn wait_random n times with the specified max_delay.

    wait_n should return the list of all the delays (float values).
    The list of the delays should be in ascending order without
    using sort() because of concurrency.
